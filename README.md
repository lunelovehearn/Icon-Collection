# Icon-Collection
## A collection of icons for Microsoft Windows and Linux systems.


**This repository was made with the intention of releasing my private icon collection that I used to use with Windows 7. Since nowadays I use Arch Linux, I have no real use for those. so, I think it's time to release them to the public. I don't remember the sources of the icons, yet I do want to credit the designers and people who worked hard on it. Mostly Microsoft design team for the Aero UI interface.**

## Instructions for Windows users:

Just git clone or zip download this repo, then use the icons to your liking.

## Instructions for Linux users:

same as Windows users, but you can use the PNG files instead.

## TO-DO: 
I would like someone to make a proper icon theme based off the Aero icons or any one that is suitable for an icon pack for Linux systems. if you're a dev, or know how to package those for Arch, Fedora and Debian based distros, please contact me so you can properly package those.
I will update the repo when I get free time. 

you can also contribute with your own icons, be it as .ico or PNG files.
